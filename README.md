# osgeopy-code of python

Code for the book [*Geoprocessing with Python*](http://manning.com/garrard/?a_aid=geopy&a_bid=c3bae5be).

Corresponding data files can be found at <https://app.box.com/s/1cwdnolsmtf0s04o0hshbv4vxiuqcmi9> (it used to be on github, but the raster files were well past github's file size limit).

The source code for the ospybook module referenced in the text is in the ospybook folder. You can install it like this:

```bash
pip install [path_to_osgeopy-code]/ospybook-latest.zip
```

Or directly from GitHub like this:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/cgarrard/osgeopy-code/raw/master/ospybook-latest.zip
```

Note that these commands are not run from a Python session. Instead, run them from a terminal window. If pip is not in your path, just provide the full path to it. For example, I could run it from a command prompt on my Windows machine like this:

```text
C:\Python33\Scripts\pip install https://github.com/cgarrard/osgeopy-code/raw/master/ospybook-latest.zip
```
